# latecharges
An R script that was used to make a OLS linear regression on a data set of mortgage late charges. 

This was developed for an academic paper which explored whether a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant relationship could be established using ordinary least squares lienar regression between late charges and the demographics of the primary borrower (age, race, gender), their credit score, and their mortgage statistics (interest rate, term).
